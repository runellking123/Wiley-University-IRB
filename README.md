## IRB Setup Action Plan

### Priority 1: FWA + IRB Registration (OHRP)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks processing (critical path)
**Cost:** Free
**Where:** [OHRP Electronic Filing System](https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/) | [OHRP Home](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp)

**Key Links:**
- [File a New FWA](https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/) - Electronic filing portal
- [FWA Instructions](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/fwa-instructions/index.html)
- [FWA Form](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/fwa-form-2017/index.html)
- [FWA Terms](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/fwas/fwa-protection-of-human-subjecct/index.html)
- [Assurance Process FAQs](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/assurance-process/index.html)
- OHRP Contact: IRBorFWA@hhs.gov | (866) 447-4777

#### Federalwide Assurance (FWA) Application
- [ ] Obtain President's signed authorization letter
- [ ] Identify and designate IRB Chair (name + contact info)
- [ ] Define planned IRB composition (member roster)
- [ ] File FWA application through [OHRP's electronic system](https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/)

#### IRB Registration (Separate from FWA, same portal)
- [ ] Register the IRB as a board (name, chair, member roster)
- [ ] Link IRB registration to FWA once filed

> **Note:** Without the FWA, the IRB has no federal standing. Even for non-funded research, this must be in place. Everything depends on this step.

### Priority 2: CITI Program - Institutional Subscription
**Timeline:** Account setup is quick (days), but members need 1-2 weeks to complete courses
**Cost:** ~$1,500-$3,000/year depending on institution size
**Where:** [CITI Program](https://about.citiprogram.org)

- [ ] Set up institutional account for Wiley University (not individual accounts)
- [ ] Configure required courses for IRB members and researchers
- [ ] Begin IRB member training
- [ ] Begin researcher certification (Human Subjects Research - HSR)
- [ ] Responsible conduct of research training

> **Why institutional:** Allows you to control which courses are required, track completion for all researchers and IRB members, and costs less per person.

---

### Priority 3: Internal Setup (Can proceed in parallel while waiting on OHRP)
- [ ] Develop IRB policies and procedures (SOPs)
- [ ] Create submission forms and templates
- [ ] Establish review workflows
- [ ] Draft informed consent templates
- [ ] Set up record-keeping systems

## What You Do NOT Need Externally (Yet)

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| AAHRPP Accreditation | Optional, typically pursued later by mature IRBs. Not needed for launch. |
| PRIM&R Membership | Helpful for resources and conferences but not required. |
| Legal Counsel Review | Good idea but internal, not an external filing. |
| IRB Software Vendor | Optional; you can start manual. |

## Priority Summary

| Priority | Action | Who | Why First |
|----------|--------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | FWA + IRB Registration | OHRP | 4-6 week wait; everything depends on it |
| 2 | CITI Institutional Account | CITI Program | Chair and members need to start training ASAP |
| 3 | Everything else | Internal | Can proceed in parallel while waiting on OHRP |

---

## Bottom Line
Get the President's signature and IRB Chair identified, then file the FWA as soon as possible. The 4-6 week processing clock is ticking whether you're ready or not, and nothing else can go fully live until it comes back approved.
